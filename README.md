# Web Development and API Design Project
### Exam Score: Grade A (Top 5% of the cohort)

## Overview

This repository showcases a web application developed during the Web Development and API Design course at Kristiania University College. The project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, with a focus on creating scalable, efficient, and secure web solutions. The project features a chat application with user profiles and incorporates a suite of modern technologies including React, Express, MongoDB, Heroku, Jest, and WebSockets, highlighting my capability in both Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture and RESTful API design.

## Features

- User authentication via OpenID Connect with Google and Microsoft Entra ID
- Real-time chat functionality using WebSockets
- Persistence of chat messages in MongoDB
- User profile creation and viewing with the ability to edit personal details
- SPA built with React, utilizing React Router for navigation
- RESTful API with Express for data operations with robust error handling
- Full deployment on Heroku with continuous integration and delivery pipelines

## Technical Requirements

- Responsive web design
- Server-side and client-side error handling with user feedback
- Automated test suite with coverage of 50-70%
- Code formatting with Prettier and Husky for linting
- Consistent use of the HTTP methods GET, POST, and PUT for RESTful services

## Setup Instructions

To run this application locally:

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
2. Install dependencies for both the client and server with `npm install`.
3. Start both the client and server concurrently using `npm run dev`.
4. Run tests with `npm test` to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Testing

- Comprehensive tests are written using Jest.
- To run the test suite, use the command `npm test` in both the client and server directories.

## Reflection

Throughout the development of this application, I have deepened my understanding of web development practices, especially in the context of SPA and API design. The challenges I faced, particularly in ensuring real-time communication and secure authentication, have strengthened my skills and proficiency in the technologies used.

## Additional Notes

- The project follows the functional requirements as outlined in the exam paper.
